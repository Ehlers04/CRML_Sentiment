1,(Nasdaq: CRML) just released a huge update: they’ve appointed a dedicated project delivery team to fast track development of the Tanbreez rare earth project in southern Greenland. 💪🔥
2,"Just in: While headlines bounce around, CRML is quietly executing. Today the company announced a fully built Project Delivery Team to fast-track Tanbreez: • Tier-1 mining, processing, and engineering leadership • 30–50+ years experience across rare earths, lithium, and critical minerals • Pilot plant, engineering, and permitting work actively underway • Coordination spanning Greenland, the U.S., Europe, and allied partners This is real progress, not speculation. No change to fundamentals. No setback to the core thesis. Price moves don’t change execution — teams like this do."

5,"Not a fan of penny stocks and in fact, I discourage investing in them, but this is too compelling. This company owns 48,036,338 shares of $CRML and owns 7.5% of the Tanbreez rare earth minerals project in Greenland. Their market cap is less than the value of their CRML stock holding. It’s trading as it is because no one has ever heard of the company and trades OTC."
6,Well well well... Howard Lutnick acquired $2 billion worth of Critical Metals Corp. $CRML back in Feb 2024. He was underwater -90% until Trump won the election. The Tanbreez project in southern Greenland is one of the largest heavy Uranium (REE) deposits globally.
7,"acquires (orders) a $1M integrated mobile geochemical lab for its Tanbreez rare earth project in Greenland. It’s a two-module 40-ft setup with automated sample prep plus a Bruker Micro-XRF system the company says can deliver REE results in ~80 minutes, aiming to cut assay turnaround vs off-site labs. Still subject to local approvals to commission and operate."
8,"being sub .30 is so insane $300 mil market cap + 58 mil shares of CRML worth $1.7 billion+ %7.5 ownership of Tanbreez worth billions, $75 mil cash on hand + 7 million additional shares they will be rewarded since $CRML is over 20$ + the value of the Wolfsberg Project"
9,1/12 BLBX just announced its merger target REalloys secured a massive 10-year offtake agreement for 15% of the world-class Tanbreez rare earth project in Greenland—6.75M metric tons of concentrate over the decade. This isn't just another mining deal; it's a strategic chess move positioning the combined entity at the center of North America's critical minerals independence
10,"The Macro Setup is PERFECT: China just imposed sweeping export restrictions on rare earths specifically targeting foreign militaries (announced Oct 9th). China controls 60% of global mining and 90% of processing. Meanwhile, the Pentagon is building a $1B+ critical minerals stockpile, with Trump's OBBA allocating $7.5B for supply chain investments. The timing couldn't be better."
11,BREAKING: Critical Metals is up over 100% this week and another 27% during pre-market! The Trump administration is eying a stake in $CRML Greenland rare earth project. They secured a $35 million PIPE to fund the Tanbreez project! We have this name on watch

14,"REPORTS NEW DRILLING RESULTS FROM GREENLAND PROJECT Critical Metals Corp. announced results from three diamond drill holes at its Tanbreez rare earth project in Greenland, intersecting mineralization with Total Rare Earth Oxide grades between 0.40-0.42%. Heavy rare earth oxides comprised approximately 26% of TREO, with zirconium oxide grades of 1.57-1.58% and gallium oxide concentrations of 93-99 ppm. The holes ranged from 62.3 to 107.45 meters depth, with mineralization remaining open at depth in all cases. Critical Metals completed 14 holes totaling 1,316 meters in 2024 and has drilled 11 holes for approximately 1,900 meters in 2025 as part of resource upgrade efforts. Executive Chairman Tony Sage highlighted the ""consistent grades of rare earth and gallium, with a high proportion of critical heavy rare earths"" positioning the project as strategically important for Western supply chains. The Fjord Deposit contains 23.6 million tonnes at 0.42% TREO established in 2016."
15,"LOCKS $120M LOI FROM U.S. EXIM BANK Critical Metals has secured a $120M non-dilutive funding LOI from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to help kickstart its Tanbreez rare earth project in Greenland. The 15-year term loan, part of the U.S. Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative, would cover early-stage development as the company targets annual output of up to 85,000 metric tons. Total capex needed is $290M. CRML aims to complete a definitive feasibility study by year-end and could boost its ownership in Tanbreez to 92.5%."
16,"NEW: NY-based Critical Metals Corp. announced the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) has offered a $120M loan to develop the Tanbreez Project, one of the world’s largest rare earth deposits located in Greenland. The company's leaders seem to understand the assignment: disrupt China's control of the rare earths market. ""Tanbreez is a world-class asset that will provide mission-critical rare earth metals to counter China’s continued dominance,” said Tony Sage, CEO and Chairman of Critical Metals Corp. “We are now razor focused to put Tanbreez into production as soon as possible.”"
17,a $200M market cap secures $120M LOI from EXIM bank. Market doesn't seem to be paying attention here imo as traders keep chasing 
18,it seems like the market has not made the Greenland connection here.
19,remains one of my top speculative picks as tensions with China rise over rare earths. The U.S. lobbied in favor of CRML to purchase a Greenland project blocking China. Technically appears to be forming a rounding bottom setup.
20,"This went largely unnoticed when it’s reported in January. US and Danish officials lobbied Tanbreez Mining, the developer of Greenland's largest rare earths deposit, last year not to sell its project to -linked firms. US officials who visited the project in southern Greenland twice last year had repeatedly shared a message with the cash-strapped company: do not sell the large deposit to a Beijing-linked buyer. Tanbreez was ultimately sold to New York-based Critical Metals for $5 million in cash and $211 million in Critical Metals stock (far less than what firms offered) as part of a complex deal that will be completed later this year. Tanbreez aims to mine 500,000 metric tons annually of the crimson rare earths-containing mineral eudialyte as soon as 2026. A rival Greenland rare earths project from Energy Transition Minerals — which counts Shenghe as its largest shareholder — has stalled amid protracted legal disputes. Critical Metals' third-largest investor is brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, led by Howard Lutnick. The Tanbreez deposit is about 30% heavy rare earths, which are used widely in defense applications. The site also contains gallium, on which China imposed export restrictions last year. Critical Metals has held supply talks with defense contractor Lockheed Martin and has upcoming talks with RTX and Boeing. GreenRoc has applied for an exploitation license to develop a Greenland graphite project and has held funding talks with US officials in the past year. Neo Performance Materials and Anglo American are also exploring on the island."
21,"Winning The report comes amid President-elect Donald Trump’s growing insistence on acquiring the Danish-controlled territory US officials persuaded Greenland-based Tanbreez Mining to reject Chinese offers to purchase its key rare earths project, Reuters reported on Friday, citing the company’s CEO Greg Barnes. The deposit was eventually sold to a US-based firm. Rare earth minerals are critical components in advanced technologies and military equipment due to their strong magnetic properties, making them strategically important in industries ranging from electric vehicles to missile systems. The Tanbreez deposit at Kringlerne, in southern Greenland, is about 30% heavy rare earths. Among other minerals, the site contains gallium, which is common in semiconductors, transistors, and small electronic devices. However, the privately owned developer struggled with funding for extraction and was forced to consider offers to sell the deposit. Barnes told Reuters he received a number of bids for the project from Chinese firms. However, he also claimed that US officials, who visited the project twice last year, had repeatedly insisted that he not sell the deposit to a Beijing-linked buyer. According to the executive, he eventually decided to sell to Critical Metals, a New York-based mining development firm, as offers from Chinese and other companies had not clearly indicated how they would pay."
22,"US officials pressured a Greenland-based precious minerals group not to sell a rare-earth project to Chinese investors, the company’s chief executive has claimed. Speaking to Reuters, Tanbreez Mining CEO Greg Barnes confirmed that the deposit was eventually sold to a US-based firm.'"
